Create git commit for a completed migration TODO following project workflow.

## Steps

1. **Verify TODO complete**:
   - Ask: "Which TODO are you committing? (e.g., 1.1, 1.2)"
   - Run full test suite: `mvn test`
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - If tests fail: STOP and tell user to fix first

2. **Review changes**:
   - Run: `git status`
   - Run: `git diff`
   - Show user what files changed
   - Confirm changes match TODO scope

3. **Stage files**:
   - Run: `git add [files]`
   - Stage only files related to this TODO
   - Include both implementation AND test files

4. **Create commit with detailed message**:

   Format:
   ```
