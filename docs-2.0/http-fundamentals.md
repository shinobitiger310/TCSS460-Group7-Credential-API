## What is HTTP?

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's an **application protocol** that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web browsers, web servers, and other web-based applications.

### Think of HTTP Like a Conversation

Imagine ordering food at a restaurant:

1. **You (Client)** ask the waiter for a menu
2. **Waiter (Server)** brings you the menu
3. **You** order a specific dish
4. **Waiter** brings your food or tells you it's not available

HTTP works similarly:

1. **Browser/App (Client)** requests a web page or data
2. **Web Server** processes the request
3. **Server** responds with the requested content or an error message
4. **Client** displays the result to the user

### Why HTTP Matters for Developers

**üéØ Learning Objective:** Understand HTTP's role in modern web development

HTTP is crucial because it:

- **Enables web browsing** - Every website you visit uses HTTP/HTTPS
- **Powers APIs** - REST APIs (like ours) are built on HTTP
- **Supports modern apps** - Web apps, mobile apps, and services communicate via HTTP
- **Provides standards** - Common rules that all web technologies follow

---

## Core HTTP Concepts

### 1. Client-Server Model

**Clients** (browsers, mobile apps, other servers) make **requests** to **servers**, which send back **responses**.

```
[Client] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Request ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Server]
         ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Response ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
```

**üîß Try It:** Visit any endpoint in our [API documentation](http://localhost:8000/api-docs) - your browser is the client, our Express server is the server.

### 2. Stateless Protocol

Each HTTP request is **independent** - the server doesn't remember previous requests. This makes HTTP:

- **Scalable** - Servers don't need to store session data
- **Reliable** - Failed requests don't affect future requests
- **Simple** - Each request contains all necessary information

**Real Example:** When you refresh a web page, the server treats it as a completely new request.

### 3. Request-Response Cycle

Every HTTP interaction follows this pattern:

1. **Client sends a request** with:
   - What it wants (method like GET, POST)
   - Where to find it (URL)
   - How to handle it (headers)
   - Optional data (body)

2. **Server sends a response** with:
   - Success or failure status
   - Response headers
   - Optional content (body)

**üîß Try It:** Test `GET /jwt_test` in our API - notice the request you send and response you receive.

### 4. Human-Readable Protocol

HTTP messages are text-based, making them easy to read and debug:

```http
GET /jwt_test HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8000
Accept: application/json

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "JWT endpoint is working",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## HTTP in Action: Our TCSS-460-auth-squared

Our TCSS-460-auth-squared demonstrates these HTTP fundamentals:

### Basic Communication
- **`GET /jwt_test`** - Simple test endpoint for request-response
- **`POST /auth/login`** - User authentication
- **`POST /auth/register`** - User registration

### Different Request Types
- **Query Parameters**: `GET /auth/verify/email/confirm?token=abc123`
- **Path Parameters**: `GET /admin/users/:id`
- **Request Body**: `POST /auth/register` with user data
- **Headers**: All authenticated endpoints require `Authorization` header with JWT token

### Response Patterns
- **Success responses** with data
- **Error responses** with helpful messages
- **Consistent structure** across all endpoints

**üîß Practice:** Explore these patterns in our [interactive documentation](http://localhost:8000/api-docs)

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Protocol** | Rules for communication | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP |
| **Client** | Requests resources | Browser, mobile app, Postman |
| **Server** | Provides resources | Web server, API server |
| **Request** | Client's message to server | "GET /auth/login" |
| **Response** | Server's reply to client | "200 OK" with data |
| **URL** | Resource address | `http://localhost:8000/auth/login` |
| **Method** | Type of request | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| **Status Code** | Response result | 200 (success), 404 (not found) |
| **Headers** | Request/response metadata | Content-Type, Authorization |
| **Body** | Optional message content | JSON data, form data |

---

## HTTP vs HTTPS

### HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- **Port 80** by default
- **Unencrypted** communication
- **Suitable for** development and non-sensitive data

### HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
- **Port 443** by default
- **Encrypted** with TLS/SSL
- **Required for** production applications with user data
- **Provides** authentication, integrity, and confidentiality

**üéØ Learning Objective:** Understand when to use HTTP vs HTTPS

Our development API uses HTTP for simplicity, but production APIs should use HTTPS.

---

## Real-World Applications

### Web Browsing
Every time you visit a website, your browser uses HTTP to:
1. Request the HTML page
2. Request CSS stylesheets
3. Request JavaScript files
4. Request images and other resources

### API Integration
Modern applications use HTTP APIs to:
- Fetch user data from databases
- Process payments
- Send notifications
- Integrate with third-party services

### Mobile Applications
Mobile apps use HTTP to:
- Sync data with cloud servers
- Download content updates
- Submit user-generated content
- Authenticate users

## REST: Building on HTTP Foundations

### What is REST?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing web APIs that use HTTP methods and status codes in a consistent, predictable way. REST isn't a protocol itself‚Äîit's a set of guidelines for how to use HTTP effectively for API design.

**üéØ Learning Objective:** Understand how REST builds upon HTTP fundamentals to create well-designed APIs

### Why REST Matters

REST provides **structure and consistency** to API design by defining how to use HTTP's features in standardized ways. Instead of each API inventing its own conventions, REST gives us proven patterns that:

- **Make APIs predictable** - Similar operations work similarly across different APIs
- **Leverage HTTP effectively** - Use HTTP methods and status codes as intended
- **Enable scalability** - Stateless design supports horizontal scaling
- **Improve maintainability** - Clear patterns make code easier to understand

### REST Principles

**1. Stateless**
Each request contains all information needed to process it‚Äîno server-side session storage.

```typescript
// ‚úÖ RESTful: Request contains all needed information
GET /admin/users?page=1&limit=20&role=3

// ‚ùå Not RESTful: Relies on server remembering previous requests
GET /api/v1/setUser/Alice    // Sets server state
GET /api/v1/getUserData      // Depends on previous call
```

**2. Client-Server**
Clear separation between client and server responsibilities (covered in [Client-Server Architecture](/docs/client-server-architecture.md)).

**3. Cacheable**
Responses should indicate if they can be cached for performance.

```typescript
// Our API could add caching headers
response.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'max-age=300'); // Cache for 5 minutes
```

**4. Uniform Interface**
Consistent resource identification and manipulation using standard HTTP methods.

```typescript
// ‚úÖ RESTful: Uniform interface for user resources
GET    /users/123     // Retrieve user
POST   /users         // Create new user
PUT    /users/123     // Update entire user
DELETE /users/123     // Remove user
```

**5. Layered System**
Architecture can have multiple layers (load balancers, caches, proxy servers, etc.) without affecting the client-server interaction.

### REST in Our TCSS-460-auth-squared

Our TCSS-460-auth-squared demonstrates RESTful principles:

**Stateless Operations:**
```typescript
// Each request is independent - authentication via JWT token
// From /src/routes/open/index.ts
openRoutes.post('/auth/login', validateLogin, AuthController.login);
openRoutes.post('/auth/register', validateRegister, AuthController.register);

// No server-side session storage - all state in JWT token
// Each request contains authentication token in headers
```

**Uniform Interface:**
```typescript
// Consistent HTTP method usage for user resource
// From /src/routes/admin/index.ts
adminRoutes.get('/users', validateAdminUsersList, AdminController.getAllUsers);        // List
adminRoutes.post('/users/create', validateAdminCreateUser, AdminController.createUser); // Create
adminRoutes.get('/users/:id', AdminController.getUserById);                            // Retrieve
adminRoutes.put('/users/:id', checkRoleHierarchy, AdminController.updateUser);         // Update
adminRoutes.delete('/users/:id', checkRoleHierarchy, AdminController.deleteUser);      // Delete
```

**Meaningful Status Codes:**
```typescript
// Appropriate HTTP status codes in our API
// 200 OK - Successful authentication
// 201 Created - User registered successfully
// 400 Bad Request - Invalid credentials
// 401 Unauthorized - Missing or invalid token
// 403 Forbidden - Insufficient permissions
// 404 Not Found - User not found
```

**üîß Try It:** Explore our RESTful patterns in [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/api-docs) - notice how similar operations use consistent HTTP methods

### REST vs Non-REST Examples

**RESTful API Design:**
```
GET    /api/v1/users          // List all users
GET    /api/v1/users/123      // Get specific user
POST   /api/v1/users          // Create new user
PUT    /api/v1/users/123      // Update user completely
PATCH  /api/v1/users/123      // Update user partially
DELETE /api/v1/users/123      // Delete user
```

**Non-RESTful API Design:**
```
GET  /api/v1/getUsers         // RPC-style naming
POST /api/v1/createUser       // Action in URL
POST /api/v1/updateUser/123   // Wrong method for update
GET  /api/v1/deleteUser/123   // Dangerous: GET with side effects
```

### Benefits of RESTful Design

**For Developers:**
- **Predictable patterns** - Similar operations work similarly
- **Self-documenting** - URLs and methods indicate functionality
- **Tool support** - HTTP tools work seamlessly

**For Applications:**
- **Cacheable responses** improve performance
- **Stateless design** enables scaling
- **Standard HTTP** leverages existing infrastructure

**For Users:**
- **Consistent behavior** across different APIs
- **Better error messages** through standard status codes
- **Reliable interactions** due to proven patterns

### Common REST Misconceptions

**‚ùå "REST requires JSON"**
REST is format-agnostic. Our API uses JSON, but REST APIs can serve XML, HTML, or other formats.

**‚ùå "REST forbids all state"**
REST forbids *server-side session state*. Database storage and client-side state are fine.

**‚ùå "REST requires exact HTTP semantics"**
REST is pragmatic. Perfect HTTP semantics matter less than consistent, useful patterns.

**üéØ Learning Objective:** REST is about using HTTP effectively, not following rigid rules
